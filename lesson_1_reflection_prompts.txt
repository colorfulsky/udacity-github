How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It will provide the part I should pay my attention to,because different
	code lead a different result.So,what you should do is just checking what
	the difference between two files .

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Obeviously,you can make it clearly that how the things go different.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Git means more freedom also more duty.Google docs' autosave is a good idea
	for the person they are a little 'lazy'.But,it's reasonable using autosave
	pattern when just use it in the internet explore.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files like google docs usually contain all what it need in all file,so you
	just need tract what the different is in this file.On the contrary,code
	files usually need resource from other files;even,them are separated in
	the surface .

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I will try to something different,it will help me to make it cheaper than
	before it value a lot.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
