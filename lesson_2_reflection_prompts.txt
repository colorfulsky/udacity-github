What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Usally I can capture that Git create a new repo and make a hide catalogue
named '.git',it also show me the message -- repo initlize.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Obviously,staging area just keep the changes of the files you Traced,but it
will not tell you the history of what you have fixed.The repo works here.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Clearly,we use more parameters to help us make it.In Git,we use "git log
--graph branch1 branch2" to show the structure of git systems.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
It will keep the lines in two files both,and make a mixture file if there
something different.For this,you must make a choice what should be
droped.Or,just go back by using "git merge --abort".

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
In manual,it will be more easier to control what we want.Obviously,if you use
manually merge it will be more convinent.
